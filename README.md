# Calendar Writer

A simple Python script that outputs a calendar from a given start date to a given end date. Used for generating calendars that I use for personal purposes.

The start date and end date are variables that need to be changed within the script itself.

Run the script in the same directory with
```
python3 calendar_writer
```
